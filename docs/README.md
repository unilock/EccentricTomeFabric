This is a port of [Eccentric Tome](https://github.com/EccentricVamp/EccentricTome) from Forge to Fabric under the LGPL-3.0 license.

***

This mod adds a single item: the Eccentric Tome.

The Tome solves a single problem: managing all of your guide books.

The Tome allows many (infinite?) books to be combined into a single item, and enables them to be retrieved when needed.

## Crafting

Craft the Tome in the crafting grid with a book and a bookcase

## Controls

`Right-click` while holding Tome to open the book selection screen

`Shift` + `Right-click` while holding Tome to convert to the book for the block you're looking at

`Left-click` on air to revert a book back into the Tome

`Shift` + `Q` while holding the converted tome to eject a book from it

## Caution

**Single-use items added to the tome will still be single use!**

Items that vanish or break (such as Tome of Helmets or Galactic Tome) will cause the Eccentric Tome to vanish or break along with all the books stored inside of it.
